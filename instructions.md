## Brushing Teeth

Some written instructions here. Maybe numbered:

  1. Pick up your toothbrush.
  2. Turn on the cold water from the faucet (usually right hand side).
  3. Place the bristle end of the toothbrush in the running water.
  4. Apply a half of a penny size drop of toothpaste onto the bristle end of the toothbrush.
  5. Think about the teeth in your mouth as quartiles.
  6. Start with the bottom right quartile and in a circular motion, with the bristles tilted slightly downward, brush all teeth in that quartile for 30 seconds.
  7. After 30 seconds is up, move to a quartile that you have not yet brushed. Repeat this process until all quartiles are brushed.
  8. Spit into the sink, run the water from the faucet to flush the sink out and go about your day!
