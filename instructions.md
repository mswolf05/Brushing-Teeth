## Brushing Teeth

  1. Pick up your toothbrush.
  2. Turn on the cold water from the faucet (usually right hand side).
  3. Place the bristle end of the toothbrush in the running water.
  4. Turn off water.
  5. Apply a half of a penny size drop of toothpaste onto the bristle end of the toothbrush.
  6. Think about the teeth in your mouth as quartiles.
  7. Start with the bottom right quartile and in a circular motion, with the bristles tilted slightly downward, brush all teeth in that quartile for 30 seconds.
  8. After 30 seconds is up, move to a quartile that you have not yet brushed. Repeat this process until all quartiles are brushed.
  9. Spit into the sink, run the water from the faucet to flush the sink out and go about your day!

## Tying Shoes

  1. Pick a pair of shoes to wear for the day and loosen the laces on both.
  2. Identify which shoe is for which foot.
  3. Put the left shoe on your left foot.
  4. Tighten the lace loops working from the loops closest to the toe box and working your way up to towards your ankle.
  5. Pull the ends of the laces straight and tight.
  6. Weave the right lace under the left and pull both laces tight.
  7. Take the right lace and make a loop (also know as a bunny ear).
  8. Take the left lace and weave it around the bunny ear.
  9. Grab half way up the left lace and pull it through the loop that was created after the weave around the bunny ear.
  10. Pull tight to create a knot with a bunny ear on either side.
  11. Repeat steps 2 through 10 with your right shoe and foot.
